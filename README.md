# justcharts

> Just charts. Really.

The goal of this project is to make it incredibly easy to hack together a [vegalite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) dashboard declaratively.

## usage 

You can use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh) to deliver the `justcharts.js` file via CDN. Note
that you'll also need to have some vega dependencies around.
